There once was a flughafen in Raesfeld.
It had an amazing biergarten.
That's where Ratskeller were sitting and eating Bratwurst.
Inconsequentially, a hund was gnawing on some stale brot nearby.
Every morning, Dr. Mehlhase drove in a pink Porsche, listening to Rammstein.
Needless to say, it annoys the Eltz's when she drives by their Schloss. 
It antagonized them so much, they moved to Berlin.
I was so happy to hear they moved that I went to the flughafen to watch their plane leave.
Finally I can listen to my favorite songs "Ohne Dich" and "Mein Herz Brennt" without interruption.
